EssMq

ESS was a group I worked in at the time I wrote this. 
The program is basically a command line interface to
read and write messages from WebSphere MQ.

It can be used in a batch mode to push a bunch of messages
from text files into MQ.

More typically, you'd use a JEE application to interface
with JMS/MQ but this happened to be used as an integration
piece where an application could export messages but had no
native MQ or JMS interface.
